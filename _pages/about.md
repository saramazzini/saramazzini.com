Hello! I am Sara Mazzini, welcome to my website! I am currently a PhD student in [The Communicative Brain Group] (www.mpi.nl/department/communicative-brain/21) at Max Planck institute for Psycholinguistics. Within my PhD studies, I aim at investigating the role of neural synchrony in face-to-face communication, under the supervision of Dr. Linda Drijvers and Dr. Judith Holler. In my previous projects I focused on neural oscillations of language production both in healthy and in patient populations.
