<span style="color: #307D7E"> **Hello! I am Sara Mazzini, welcome to my website!** </span>  

I am currently a PhD student in  [The Communicative Brain Group](https://www.mpi.nl/department/communicative-brain/21) at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. I have always been fascinated by languages and by how these are processed in the brain. Especially, how do our brains learn, produce and perceive language?  

Besides the curiosity for the neurobiological basis of language, I am intrigued by neural oscillations and their role in human cognition. For my Master thesis, I focused on the role of low frequency neural oscillations in syntactic encoding during language production. Within my PhD studies, I am moving toward a two-person perspective, by investigating the role of neural synchrony in face-to-face communication both within and between conversational partners.
