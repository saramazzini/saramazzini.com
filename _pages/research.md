### "Oscillatory correlates of syntactic encoding: a comparison between classic galactosemia patients and healthy subjects" 

For my Master thesis, I investigated the oscillatory activity related to syntactic encoding during a guided sentence production experiment both in healthy populations and in patients diagnosed with classic galactosemia. Classic galactosemia (CG) is a rare metabolic diseas affecting several cognitive functions, among which language production. Previous studies reported impairments in the ERP profile of CG patients, in particular in ERP components related to lexical and syntacting encoding, suggesting that these stages of the language production process might be affected. Considering these findings and the reported white matter anormalities in CG, we expected that also the patients' oscillatory profile would be impaired. In order to address our research question, we analyzed the dataset collected by Timmers et al. (2012) with a time-frequency approach with EEGLAB toolbox. 

###Â "The role of intra- and inter-brain neural synchrony in face-to-face communication" 
Synchronized neural oscillations are thought to be relevant for selecting and transferring information within and between cortical areas. In particular, neural synchrony seems to facilitate the integration of stimuli coming from different sensory modalities. In the recent years, neural synchrony has not only been investigated within a brain (intra-brain synchrony), but also between brains (inter-brain synchrony) while individuals engage in social interactions.

During face-to-face communication, auditory and visual information (i.e. speech and gestures) need to be integrated into a meaningful message and this process is likely driven by neural synchrony between the cortical areas involved. Nonetheless, the role of neural synchrony during natural conversation is not clear yet. Namely, it is still unknown whether intra- and inter-brain synchrony are necessary and/or beneficial for effective face-to-face communication. Within this project, we will the hypothesis whether neural synchrony plays a mechanistic role in integrating different sources of information within and between conversational partners. More specifically, we aim to unravel whether  intra- and inter-brain neural synchrony is necessary, or even required for, successful communication. In a later stage, non-invasive multibrain stimulation (tACS) will be used to externally manipulate endogenous neural synchrony that may be relevant for successful communication, to measure its causal effect on face-to-face communication in both native and non-native language contexts.
